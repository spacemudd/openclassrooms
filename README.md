- 2 weeks ago I wrapped up the WordPress project.

- My mentor set up a client validation session for me.

- The validation failed because the contact form suddenly stopped sending emails. I enabled PHP errors on both Pantheon.io and WP's ends, yet, the error was vague and PHP was not emitting any errors. My gut said something wrong with the email server. After failing and discussing it with my mentor, we were not able to get it working.

- A week later, I attempted to try the contact form again, and woop, it works! WP was not modified in any way since the validation session. Nevertheless, I'm not taking chances and have used a plugin to create forms that doesn't require sending out emails.
